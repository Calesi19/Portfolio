## Wireframing and Styling

In the construction of most websites, I invariably create wireframes, though for this particular site, I departed from this usual practice. This website was crafted instinctively, guided by my intuition and aesthetic sensibilities, in a bid to best represent my personality. I resonate with the principles of minimalism and orderliness, values which have heavily influenced my design approach.

Taking cues from Apple's iconic style, I was inspired by their use of white space and sleek simplicity. However, I opted for a subtle deviation, incorporating alterations that I felt resonated more with my unique style. Numerous portfolios that I've come across boasted intricate designs and comprehensive showcases, and while they were impressive, my vision for my own site was different. I aspired to maintain simplicity and clarity, shying away from ostentatious displays.

My ultimate goal was to design a website that's straightforward and easy to navigate. I aimed to provide essential information about me in an accessible manner, without superfluous distractions. Thus, the site offers an uncluttered and direct reflection of my work and persona.

## Deployment
To deploy the website, I'm using the static site hosting service offered by GitHub:  GitHub Pages.
