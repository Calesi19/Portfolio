                <h3>Resilience</h3>
                
                <p>
                    What makes me a unique candidate is my proactiveness and ability to lead in challenging situations. I have strong skills in Python, C++, and Web Development, often outperforming my peers in these areas. My portfolio website and a Flutter app, which I chose to learn independently for my Senior Project, are testament to my design skills, adaptability, and commitment to learning new technologies.

                    <br><br>Even though I have not had formal internships or work experiences related to programming, I have taken the initiative to apply my knowledge in real-life situations, like creating a Web Scraping program to automate tasks at a previous job. This demonstrates my ability to think innovatively and use technology to improve efficiency.
                    
                    <br><br>In team projects, I frequently assume the role of lead architect or designer, organizing efforts and encouraging team members to contribute their ideas. I am not afraid to take the first step, even when the task is new or challenging. This approach has consistently led to my teams becoming fully engaged in our projects and ultimately producing successful outcomes.
                    
                    <br><br>When faced with a challenging programming issue, I have a structured approach to problem-solving which includes debugging, research, collaboration, and seeking guidance from mentors if necessary. I understand the power of collective intelligence and the importance of transparent communication in a team setting.
                    
                    <br><br>Lastly, my philosophy when learning new technologies involves not just understanding the basics, but also actively engaging with the technology through practical exercises and referencing documentation.
                    
                    <br><br>My experiences at Brigham Young University - Idaho have instilled in me a belief that I can master any technology or concept with dedication and practice. This mindset makes me a determined, adaptable, and resilient software engineer, ready to tackle any challenge and continuously grow in my career.
